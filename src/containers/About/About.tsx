                        Of course it is not possible to put my whole tech adventure into three little cards. So at this
                        point, I want to tell you my story.

                        Everything began with me starting to college. It was the first time I code, and I was astonished
                        that a machine is doing something that I want it to do. We are taught Java and C in college, and
                        until end of the second year I was not interested in new programming language. I was learning
                        the basics, afterall. In my first years, my attention mostly focused on my classes. I had
                        special interest in algorithm design and data structures. Then, I decided to learn Web
                        Programming.

                    <Text className={css.MakeItBigger} fontSize="1.10em">
                        I learned the basics first, how web works, what is request, response, and so on. Then I learnt
                        my first backend framework Express, and enough Html, CSS to build a website. After that, I did
                        an internship at Ekodenge, which is developing sustainability solutions in a countrywide and
                        Europe based projects. I worked as a fullstack engineer there, and got a chance to try new
                        technologies such as Electron, DjangoRestFramework, .Net. and angularJs.

                        Next, I finally met with React. Since then, it was my way to go to build a frontend. Luckily, I
                        had a chance to work with React, and Spring Boot in my internship at Innova, and these two are
                        my current strengths. Recently, I worked with Flutter a little; and loved it but I had no time
                        to study further. Nowadays, I am trying to learn a new backend framework, if I can find time
                        from my classes. I havenâ€™t decided whether it should be DjangoRest or Fastify, so I am learning
                        both in parallel till I decide one over another .

                        Coding aside, I like to design my websites and most of my projects were designed beforehand with
                        Figma.
